# MDOF-Spring-Mass-System
In my second-year, first-semester undergraduate project for the Numerical Analysis course, I focused on simulating a Multi-Degree-of-Freedom Spring-Mass System using MATLAB. 
The Differential Equations involved here were handled numerically at the time of submission of my project. But here I replaced the numerical methods with built in MATLAB function.
Different cases involving SDOF and TDOF with forced and free vibration and different damping conditions has been simulated. Keep all the .m files in the same folder.
